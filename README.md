# Stablecoin Project

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for our Stablecoin project, a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging it to a reserve of assets or a stable benchmark. Stablecoins are crucial in the cryptocurrency space to mitigate the volatility often associated with traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

## Features

- **Stability:** Our Stablecoin aims to maintain a stable value, making it suitable for everyday transactions and as a store of value.

- **Transparency:** The project is open-source, allowing for transparency and collaboration. You can review the code to understand how the Stablecoin operates.

## Testing with Foundry

We have utilized Foundry for testing purposes. Foundry provides a robust environment for simulating various scenarios and assessing the performance and reliability of our Stablecoin under different conditions.

### Foundry Features

- **Scenario Testing:** Foundry enables us to simulate different market conditions, user behaviors, and external events to evaluate how our Stablecoin responds.

- **Security Analysis:** By using Foundry, we conduct security analyses to identify potential vulnerabilities and strengthen the overall security posture of our Stablecoin.

- **Performance Metrics:** Foundry provides detailed performance metrics, helping us optimize our Stablecoin for efficiency and scalability.

## Getting Started

To run the Stablecoin locally or integrate it into your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naman1402/stablecoin

   cd stablecoin
    ```
